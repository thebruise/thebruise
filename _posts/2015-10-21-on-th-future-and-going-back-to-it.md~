Today, October 21st, 2015, is a auspicious day. A day that will forever be remembered. A cultural touchstone we all discuss, surely, for years to come. -My thirty-first birthday.-

Oh, and that Back to The Future Part 2 thing.

I remember watching BTTF2 as a kid. It came out when I was five, but I probably didn't see it until I was around eleven. The future seemed so amazing, then. I remember being so excited that they traveled to the future on what would be my birthday, but I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of the year 2015. I seemed like an unfathomably long time in the future. Even in 1995, the year 2000 seemed like a distant and foreign land, nevermind almost a decade and a half later. Hoverboards, rehydrated pizza, garbage recycling energy reactors; these all seemed like reasonable destinations in the magic future-land that was 2015.

It was so far in the future I'm not sure I ever even bothered to do the math on how old I would be. I knew I would turn sixteen in the year 2000, and get a car, and be in high school, which were really the only future things
